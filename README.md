According to subscribers' categories manifested in data table, message personalization carried out so as to bring products of such categories.

The client Madesa wanted to send personalized email messages to subscribers whose preferences for categories were expressed in an additional data table, additional to the existing Vtex table. The hierarchy of categories to be shown in messages should be as followed: Cozinha, Sala de Jantar, Quarto, Sala de Estar and Escrit√≥rio. For each category, a separate row in an HTML table should be used. For Cozinha, only one product to be exposed, while for the remaining categories, 2 products should be shown.

After creating the SQL scripts and the HTML creative with the necessary Dynamic Content, the client added more complexity, wishing to always have 5 rows in the HTML table, so as to, when one category is missing (lack of interest by the subscriber), products of desired categories should appear instead. This resulted in 32 possible combinations of products being shown, making the Dynamic Content extremely complex.

The second version of the creative, the more complex one, is not complete, but it indicates the path to be followed for its completion.
